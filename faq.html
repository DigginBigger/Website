    <h2>Common Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What about cancellations or rescheduling?</summary>
      <p>For any reason, cancellations before 48 hours notice will be fully refunded.</p>
    </details>

    </details>
       <summary>What happens if the weather is bad on the day of my event?</summary>
        <p>We reserve the right to cancel any delivery if the temperature is below
        <strong>40°F</strong> or if the weather conditions are unsafe for equipment use —
        including <strong>excessive winds, lightning, or heavy rain</strong>.
        Safety is our top priority, and all event decisions are made with safety as the first
        consideration. If local forecasts predict rain on your scheduled day,
        <strong>MM Digging</strong> may need to cancel in advance due to safety concerns.
        If rain begins <strong>after setup</strong>, the equipment will be temporarily packed up
        until it’s safe to resume. Once conditions improve, the trailer can be reconfigured and
        operated again.
        Please note that customers will <strong>not receive a refund</strong> if rain occurs after
        delivery and setup. However, we will contact you in advance to discuss options if weather
        appears to be a potential factor before your event.
