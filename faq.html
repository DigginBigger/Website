    <h2>Common Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What about cancellations or rescheduling?</summary>
      <p>For any reason, cancellations before 48 hours notice will be fully refunded.</p>
    </details>

    </details>
       <summary>What happens if the weather is bad on the day of my event?</summary>
        <p>We reserve the right to cancel any delivery if the temperature is below
        40°F or if the weather conditions are unsafe for equipment use —
        including excessive winds, lightning, or heavy rain.
        Safety is our top priority, and all event decisions are made with safety as the first
        consideration.
        If rain begins after setup, the equipment will be temporarily packed up
        until it’s safe to resume. Once conditions improve, the trailer can be reconfigured and
        operated again.
        Please note that customers will not receive a refund if rain occurs after
        delivery and setup. However, we will contact you in advance to discuss options if weather
        appears to be a potential factor before your event.
